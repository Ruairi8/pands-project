#<h2><em>Analysis of the Iris data set</em></h2>

Author: Ruairi McCool

In this project I will output summaries of the variables involved to a text file and do meaningful analyses using python on the dataset using some of it's built-in libraries. Visual distributions can be created using matplotlib and pandas libraries, for example. I could also divide the data into training and testing groups, as is done in "k nearest neighbours" in machine learning. I will also provide a written summary of the output and the conclusions I have made.
What can be gained by performing analysis and outputting mathematical statistics of the variables in this 
dataset? The answer is that it can be determined which variables and combinations of them can be used to 
distinguish each of the three varieties of iris from one another. It may be necessary to find out how reliable a method of distinguishing one variety of iris from another is, because not every method is one 
hundred percent accurate and there may be a margin of error.

<h4><em>Summary of the data set:</em></h4> 
The Iris flower data set was introduced by Robert Fisher in 1936 in his paper <i>"the use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems"</i> as an example of linear discriminant analysis. The data set contains fifty samples from each of three species of Iris (Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor). The columns contain the variables sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width measured in centimeters and species name. The rows contain the samples - 150 in total. Fisher was able to develop a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other using this information.
