<em>Summary of the data set:</em> The Iris flower data set was introduced by Robert Fisher in 1936 in his paper <i>"the use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems"</i> as an example of linear discriminant analysis. The data set contains fifty samples from each of three species of Iris (Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor). The columns contain the variables sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width measured in centimeters and species name. The rows contain the samples - 150 in total. Fisher was able to develop a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other using this information.
