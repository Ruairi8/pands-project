#<h2><em>Analysis of the Iris data set</em></h2>

Author: Ruairi McCool

In this project I will do meaningful analyses using python on the dataset, using some of it's built-in libraries. Visual distributions can be created using matplotlib and pandas libraries, for example. I could also divide the data into training and testing groups, as is done in "k nearest neighbours" in machine learning. I will aslo provide a written summary of the output and the conclusions I have made. 

<h4><em>Summary of the data set:</em></h4> 
The Iris flower data set was introduced by Robert Fisher in 1936 in his paper <i>"the use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems"</i> as an example of linear discriminant analysis. The data set contains fifty samples from each of three species of Iris (Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor). The columns contain the variables sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width measured in centimeters and species name. The rows contain the samples - 150 in total. Fisher was able to develop a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other using this information.
